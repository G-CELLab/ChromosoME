# Scene Knowledge (ChromosoME Simulation Flow)

## Global Scene Rules
- The AI agent is present the entire time.
- The instruction text box is present on the right side throughout the simulation.
- The tutor should explain what is happening now and what to do next when asked.
- If the learner asks about another phase, answer faithfully even if current phase is different.

## Entry Scene (Before Cell Phase)
- Learner enters and sees a hand with a wound in front of them.
- Goal: touch the wound for 3 seconds.
- Tutor guidance example:
  - "Touch and hold the wound for about 3 seconds to begin healing."

## Cell Interior Scene
- The environment may look like red blood cells. This visual is not a task target.
- Focus on objectives and interactive objects.

## Interphase (Gameplay Flow)

**What to do in Interphase:** Place nutrient capsules into the mitochondria to raise ATP energy, then replicate the centriole.

### Next steps and instructions:
1. Place three green nutrient capsules into the mitochondria (order does not matter):
   - Protein 
   - Magnesium 
   - Vitamin C
2. Confirm ATP increase:
   - Watch the green ATP bar rise after all three nutrients are placed.
   - This energy powers the cell's upcoming mitotic activities.
3. Replicate the centriole:
   - Find the yellow barrel-shaped centriole on the right side.
   - Grab it and move it to create a duplicate.
   - Once you have moved it, the centrioles will move to opposite sides of the cell.

### Short guidance examples
- "In Interphase, place protein, magnesium, and vitamin C into the mitochondria to raise ATP."
- "Next, grab the yellow centriole on the left to replicate it."
- "You need to bring the three green nutrient capsules to the mitochondria to make energy for the cell."
- "What should you do? Place the nutrients into the mitochondria first to raise ATP."

### Why this phase matters
- ATP (energy) is essential for the cell to perform all upcoming mitotic tasks.
- The centrioles organize the spindle apparatus that will move chromosomes in later phases.
- Interphase preparation ensures accurate and efficient mitotic division.

## Prophase (Gameplay Flow)

**What to do in Prophase:** Hold the red DNA steady so it condenses into an X-shaped chromosome. The spindle apparatus begins forming.

### Next steps and instructions:
1. Grab the red stringy DNA:
   - Locate the red DNA structure in the scene.
   - Use the grab gesture to hold it.
2. Hold it steady for about 6 seconds:
   - Condensation will happen automatically as you hold it.
   - Watch the red stringy DNA transform into a red X-shaped chromosome.

### Short guidance examples
- "In Prophase, hold the red DNA steady for about 6 seconds so it condenses into an X-shape."
- "What should you do? Grab and hold the red DNA until it becomes an X-shaped chromosome."
- "The DNA is condensing—keep holding it until the transformation completes."

### Why this phase matters
- DNA must condense into visible chromosomes before they can be moved during mitosis.
- The spindle apparatus begins forming to prepare for chromosome movement in the next phases.
- Prophase is the bridge between preparation (interphase) and active chromosome separation.

## Metaphase (Gameplay Flow)

**What to do in Metaphase:** Line up the red X-shaped chromosome with the blue chromosomes at the cell center. Yellow spindle fibers guide the placement.

### Next steps and instructions:
1. Grab the newly formed red X-shaped DNA/chromosome:
   - Locate the red X-shaped chromosome in the scene.
   - Use grab to pick it up.
2. Place it in line with the blue chromosomes:
   - Move the red chromosome to the sparkly placement area below the blue chromosomes.
   - The sparkly area marks the metaphase plate (center alignment zone).
   - Align it horizontally with the other chromosomes.
3. Observe the spindle fibers:
   - Green spindle fibers are visible and appear to hold chromosomes in place.
   - The aligned chromosomes are now ready for separation.

### Short guidance examples
- "In Metaphase, place the red X-shaped chromosome into the sparkly lineup area under the blue chromosomes."
- "What should you do? Align the red chromosome at the center with the blue ones."
- "Move the red chromosome to the center line to match up with the other chromosomes."

### Why this phase matters
- All chromosomes must align at the cell's equator (metaphase plate) to ensure each daughter cell receives exactly one copy of each chromosome.
- This precise alignment is critical for proper genetic inheritance.
- Metaphase is the checkpoint before chromosome separation.

## Anaphase (Gameplay Flow)

**What to do in Anaphase:** Split the red chromosome apart into two chromatids and move each one to opposite sides of the cell.

### Next steps and instructions:
1. Split the red chromosome apart:
   - Grab each side of the red X-shaped chromosome.
   - Pull the two sides apart to separate the sister chromatids.
   - This creates two individual chromatids (now called chromosomes after separation).
2. Place chromatids on opposite sides:
   - Grab one chromatid and move it to the left sparkly area.
   - Grab the other chromatid and move it to the right sparkly area.
   - The spindle fibers appear to assist with the pulling motion.

### Short guidance examples
- "In Anaphase, split the red chromosome into two chromatids and place one on each side."
- "What should you do? Pull the X apart and move each half to the opposite sides."
- "Grab each side of the chromosome and pull them apart toward the left and right."

### Why this phase matters
- Sister chromatids must separate and move to opposite poles so each daughter cell receives an identical complete set of chromosomes.
- Anaphase is typically very fast in real cells because the spindle forces are strong.
- This is the decisive moment—chromosomes are being distributed to the two future cells.

## Telophase (Gameplay Flow)

**What to do in Telophase:** Watch the cell complete mitosis. Chromosomes are now at opposite poles and new nuclear envelopes reform. 

### Next steps and instructions:
1. Observe chromosome arrival:
   - Nuclear envelopes begin to reform around each chromosome set.
   - Chromosomes start to decondense (unwind from their tightly packed X shape).
2. Observe cytokinesis starting:
   - The cell begins to pinch in the middle as it prepares to physically divide.
3. Exit the cell:
   - Once telophase starts, user is automatically teleported outside of the cell.
   - You should now see two separate cells where there was one before.
4. Return to the hand:
   - Touch the wound on the hand again to enter the cell for the next healing cycle.

### Short guidance examples
- "In Telophase, then touch the wound again to start the next healing cycle."
- "What should you do? Watch the nuclei reform."
- "The cell has successfully divided into two. Touch the wound to continue healing."

### Why this phase matters
- Telophase completes mitosis—each daughter cell now has a complete, identical copy of chromosomes.
- Nuclear envelopes reform to contain the decondensed chromosomes.
- After cytokinesis (physical cell division), two genetically identical daughter cells emerge to continue the organism's growth and repair.

## Progress Bars and Cycle Completion
- ATP bar (green): indicates energy progress during cell tasks.
- HP bar (red): increases when a full cell division cycle is completed.
- Total requirement: complete 3 cycles to fill HP fully.

## Important Tutor Behavior
- Keep spoken responses short and clear.
- Prefer one direct instruction sentence when learner asks "what next?"
- Avoid introducing tutorial-only objects (like hand sphere) during mitosis phases.
